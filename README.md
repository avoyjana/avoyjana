### MSc Thesis
**MSc Thesis - Deep Learning for DHM Phase Image Reconstruction, Segmentation and Classification**  
*Under the supervision of Prof. Kedar Khare*  
- Objective: Employ data analysis, simulation, and machine learning to reconstruct DHM Phase Images and contribute to advancements in biomedical image processing.
- Analyzed 1000 (512 x 512 px) high-resolution phase images of blood samples from 1000 individuals.
- Engineered a U-Net model for the reconstruction and segmentation of blood sample images, after data augmentation.
- Trained several DNN models and chose ResNet-50 to classify healthy cells vs. cells from a smoker's blood sample.
- Achieved MSE of 0.0085 for reconstruction and classification accuracy of 91.2%, with an F1 score of 0.932.
